# Assignment And Exam System

## An internal system that helps teachers to create assignments and exams, and students to work on them

**What will the application do?**

This personal project will let user sign up an account as teacher or student, and then they can log in with the created 
account. As a student, student can view the list of assignments, their types, details and deadlines. They will be able 
to work on them, and depend on the assignments, they can do it in a focused period of time, or a just a normal quiz. 
The students can also view their grade for each assignment, the overall grade for the course and other statistics about 
the course like class size, grade distribution,...

As a teacher, user can add/kick a student out of their class from the student list. Teacher can create an assignment,
edit the assignment to make it a normal quiz or an exam (within a limited period of time and number of attempt). Teacher
can edit student's assignment grade, view the overall class grade, and export the report class data.

**Who will use it**

Anyone who wants to run a class effectively with the help of a system that can track the students' examination, 
assignments and grades. It is recommended for teachers needing post assignments to students and automatically grade the
students' performance, and for students who want to work on computer and a computer-based assignment system.

**Why is this project of interest to you?**

As a student, the idea of working with a computer based assignment system like Canvas has always made me feel curious.
I question myself how such Canvas is constructed, designed and pushed into production, which has changed the world's
teaching method in a positive way. Therefore, I believe with this project, teachers everywhere can apply it to make
their class management more effective, and make students feel easier tracking the assignments' deadline and working on
exams.
